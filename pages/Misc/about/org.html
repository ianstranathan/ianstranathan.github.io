Greetings and salutations, I'm Ian and this a small archive for things I become interested in (think poor man <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html%22">Hyperphysics</a> or <a href="https://www.algorithm-archive.org">Algorithm Archive</a>).
</p>

<p>
I studied Physics (B.S.) and Math (B.S) and Mechanical Engineering (almost B.S) and I'm a hobbyist graphics programmer &amp; game developer.
</p>

<p>
I'm motivated by understanding how things work and communicating ideas.
</p>

Writing doesn't just communicate ideas; it generates them.

<p>
I find writing useful as scaffolding for synthetic, creative activities (learning something new or cataloging derivations mostly)
and sometimes that process turns into a full post here.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, I don't always have the time to proof read each post as thoroughly as I'd like <b>-</b>
I'm sure there are lots of spelling and grammar mistakes, but hopefully there aren't too many technical ones.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for stopping by and feel free to reach out. 
</p>

<p>
Cheers.
