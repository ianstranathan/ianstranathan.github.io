<p>Tl;dr: try it out <a href="../../projects/rubiksCube/index.html">here</a>)</p>
<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This is a simple Rubik's cube simulation from scratch. It has a trackball camera + point &amp; click controls.
My goal was to have intuitive controls that reflected a faithful simulation and to make it as pretty as possible.</p>
<p>These design goals naturally lead to some technical constraints and necessary pattern implementations.</p>
<!-- To achieve the point and click controls I needed to use Ray-Quad intersection tests and some projection logic.
A better lighting model (Blinn-phong) and instancing was used to utilize the high polygon model. -->
<p>Everything (model, rendering system, model i/o, raycast, aabb-ray intersection, ray-quad intersection, etc) was handmade for educational purposes.</p>
<h1 id="renderingsideofthings">Rendering side of things</h1>
<h2 id="makingamodel">Making a model</h2>
<p>Making a Rubik's cube is a pretty popular 3D modeling project and there are a large amount of 
<a href="">tutorials available online</a> (mine mirrors the first search result) by
much more component people than me. I'm not a 3D artist and have just used blender off and on for a few years as the
occasional indie game dev project has called for it. Just make a model and color it's vertices accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="loadingthemesh">Loading the mesh</h2>
<p>Importing a mesh seems daunting at first, but if you've messed around with graphics enough, at the end of the day you
know that it's just big arrays representing vertex data (positions, normals, colors etc). I imported with the .ply format and parsed it accordingly.</p>
<p>In practice this can be a little arduous and debugging this kind of thing is painful, eye bleeding work. To quote a programming superior:</p>
<p>"The model I/O is the worst and almost everybody tries to get somebody else’s code to do this." <br>--Peter Shirley, Raytracing in One Weekend </p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more, check out another <a href="#">article of mine</a> on this subject that goes into more detail.</p>
<h2 id="instancing">Instancing </h2>
<p>Given that my unoptimized model (a single "cubie") is on the order of <code class='latexWorkaround'>$5$</code> x <code class='latexWorkaround'>$10^4$</code> triangles (~~retopologyy is a thing for this reason~~ this is why unreal's nanite system was created)
I needed to speed things up by instancing them.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this <a href="https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-instanced-drawing.html">tutorial</a> by webggl2fundamentals.</p>
<h2 id="lightingmodel">Lighting Model </h2>
<p>I'm using the traditional Blinn-Phong lighting model. Check out my <a href="../Graphics/halfwayVector.html">article on the half-way vector</a> if you're derivation curious and/ or need a review.</p>
<h1 id="programmingsideofthings">Programming side of things</h1>
<h2 id="selectingthecuberayboxintersection">Selecting the cube - Ray-Box Intersection</h2>
<p>I wanted intuitive controls that reflected a faithful simulation e.g. <a href="https://rubikscu.be/">rubikscu.be</a></p>
<p>But where to start?</p>
<p>When I first started on this project, I happened to also have been working on some small raytracing projects and was fortunate to have Peter Shirley as a resource.
Raytracing methods often use axis aligned bounding boxes in Oct-trees as a broadphase check using the slab method. If you're interested in learning how that works, check out my <a href="../Graphics/rayBoxIntersection.html">article and visulizations</a> I made to debug/ understand my own convoluted slab method
implementation.</p>
<p>I opted for a broadphase check of a camera ray and an AABB representing the entire cube, if that passes an AABB of each cubie's bounds is checked with the ray
taking an early out if the maximum possible, diagonal cross section is collected. The minimum distance of of those selections is our clicked cubie.</p>
<h2 id="gettingadirectionforarotation">Getting a direction for a rotation</h2>
<p>This was by far the stickiest part of the project, I eventually came up with, what I think is a standard solution for this kind of thing: 
take the relative difference vector of two different surface intersections and project them onto the plane's basis vectors (of course culling them with the 2D quad bounds of the cubie surface),
Some edge cases ( quite literally, say if the first first intersection was exactly on an edge) and bugs were definitely in this one.</p>
<!-- ![Diagram of rotation selection logic. Note the possible edge cases of vertical and horizontal lines](../images/rubiksCube/turnSelection.png) -->

</div>
<p>Please see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93plane_intersection">wikipedia article</a> for a line-plane intersection derivation for further discussion.</p>
<p>(This is another good reminder of the importance of asking for help/ avoiding reinventing the wheel… this was all for educational purposes however and deeper understanding is impossible
without error and redudancy)</p>
<h2 id="rotatingaplaneofthecube">Rotating a plane of the Cube</h2>
<p>This is kind of where programming and graphics programming meet each other in the project.</p>
<p>Recall that for a homogenous transformation matrix used in rendering, the translation component is contained in the 12th, 13th and 14th index. </p>
<pre><code class="C language-C">mat4 aMat4 = mat4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,  // 1. column
                  0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0,  // 2. column
                  0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0,  // 3. column
                  T_x, T_y, T_z, 1.0); // 4. column
</code></pre>
<p>If you're curious or confused and want to take a deeper dive into that, check out my
<a href="../Graphics/modelViewProjection.html">article on the matrix math of the rasterization process</a></p>
<p>So far in the input handling cycle, a specific cubie (and associated rendering object) has been selected and the axis of rotation has been decided with the mouse.
To affect a rotation, each cubie is looped over and if their translation component that corresponds with the axis of rotation matches the selected cubie, 
it's transform is hit with a rotation matrix. 
But the GPU buffer also must be changed to see any corresponding change:</p>
<pre><code class="C language-C">// update a substitue float32 array and then offset into buffer correctly, replacing 9 matrices instead of 27
for(let j = 0; j &lt; 16; j++)
{
    this.theSubArr[j] = this.renderer.renderables[0].cubieTransforms[i][j];
}
gl.bufferSubData(this.gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, i * 16 * 4, this.theSubArr);
</code></pre>
<p>Floating point errors in the cubie's transformation matrix will accrue over time and its basis vectors and affine translation should be rounded after a rotation. (as a small optimization
this need only be done on the final, corrective rotation to nearest <code class='latexWorkaround'>$\frac {\pi}{2}$</code>)</p>
<h1 id="wrappingup">Wrapping up</h1>
<p>There are many ways this project could be improved upon. 
Beyond the obvious things (cleaner code: reduce the size of some classes, make things a little more SOLID + DRY etc;
use a compiled language), I think the biggest boost in visual fidelity and performance would come in reducing the size of the cubie model (retopologize) and using a better lighting model (energy conserving, PBR, raytracing etc)
or alter the current lighting model to account for certain glaring gaps / artifacts (shadow mapping - the cubies that are covered are still being shaded currently).</p>
<p>It's always humbling how much is required for so little; to do these projects that the world doesn't need is a confusing balance between unproductivity and educational value for me. </p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
