Just a weekend-ish project to play around with webgl and stay busy over the holidays.

I wanted to see if I could recreate the core of the music video for Dan Deacon's "Learning to Relax" from scratch
[The music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtjS3KN162s)

Check out the very talented Dan Deacon, I really like him:
[his sound cloud](https://soundcloud.com/dan-deacon)
and [his personal website](https://dandeacon.com/#music)

It's just a short "proof of concept", not intended to faithfully recreate the exact video.
Check out a live version on my [personal website](https://ianstranathan.com/projects/justForFun/learningToRelax/index.html)
