Update for-loops. In a game you usually have dozens of for loops, iterating over all objects in a list. Look for lists where the object update is not dependent on other objects in the list (ie. particles, or entities that don't need other entities to update). Those can easily be parallelized, with different threads updating different objects in those lists. Keep in mind that you shouldn't spawn new threads each time you update those lists, but keep the threads around (in a thread pool, for example) and then assign work to them.
