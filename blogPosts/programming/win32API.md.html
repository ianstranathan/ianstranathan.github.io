Basic windows program has two import functions inside:

Event Handler
Main function

"Messages" : Data that is sent to the event handler which tells windows what to do

"Handles" : Integers used as identifier, usually prefixed with an H

First things first -- write an event handler (message handler)
Then winmain function

After that you'll write your WinMain function
