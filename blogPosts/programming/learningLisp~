
This book takes me back to the 80s, learning how to program by
typing in complex BASIC programs out of magazines and books.
Many of the programs I typed in, I didn't understand 100%. But each time I entered a program,
I learned something, and then by tweaking the programs and seeing what it would do, I learned a little more.
