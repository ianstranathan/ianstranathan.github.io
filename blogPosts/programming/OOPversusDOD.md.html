*I'm by no means a good programmer and take everything with a grain of salt. Different abstractions exist for a reason
and there is almost never a panacea for complicated problems*

How much do I really need to care about cache misses?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, definitely. But no kinda

Are virtual functions bad?


In some niche areas people are trying to maximise memory cache efficiency, virtual functions can be problematic because the (implicit
indirection through function pointers reduces the likelihood of a cache hit.
This is definitely not something for beginners to worry about.
In general they are absolutely fine. Based on what I've seen,

The problem with this video is that it is dismissing some of the most useful core abstractions in C++ in favour of implementing them by hand in
C for no good reason (just personal preference).
That is an extremely error prone approach to managing resources and is precisely why constructors and destructors were introduced.

There is no mystery here. An unitialised object is an accident waiting to happen.
You may leak everyone's bank details, crash a car or kill a patient because you forgot to initialise a structure in just one of the five
thousand places where you create one in your code.
The author is entitled to his opinion, and he can use C all he likes, but his approach is self-defeating and should be ignored by
learners.
There are few technical advantages to preferring C these days: in terms of productivity, correctness, efficiency or whatever.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
modern security issues you usually receive allocated memory zeroed/randomized from OS,

so the performance gains by avoiding C++ initialization of memory are kinda lost
