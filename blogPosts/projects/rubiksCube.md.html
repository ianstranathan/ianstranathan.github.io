As always totally from scratch

Design Overview
===================================================

I wanted to challenge myself and make something that wasn't totally ugly, this would mean using a higher poly mesh
and a better lighting model to show it with.

Making the mesh
===================================================

Making a Rubik's cube is a pretty popular 3D modeling project and there are a large amount of tutorials available online by 
much more component people than me. I'm not a 3D artist and have just used blender off and on for a few years as the
occasional indie game dev project has called for it. Just make a model and color it's vertices accordingly.

Loading the mesh
===================================================

Importing a mesh seem's daunting at first, but if you've messed around with graphics enough, at the end of the day you
know that it's just big arrays representing vertex positions, normals and colors. I imported with the .ply format and parsed it.

Instancing 
===================================================

Given that my (overly high poly) model is on the order of $5$x$10^4$ triangles, 
I decided to speed things up by instancing the individual "cubies"
