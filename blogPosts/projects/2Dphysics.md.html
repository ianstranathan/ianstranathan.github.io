*Small project post mortem*

Tl;dr: Try it out [here](../../projects\2Dphysics\refactor\index.html)

Overview:
===============

I wanted to make a simple physics "engine" (equations of motion, basic collision) as a programming exercise 

I was inspired to do so after watching this presentation by [Steven Witten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkx1aKv2z8o&t=2399s)
(It's worth your time if you're interested in math or graphics. All his presentations, along with a host of interesting toys and articles, can be found on his incredibly polished [site:](http://acko.net/))

The fundamental idea of a physics system is very simple: incoporate the appropriate physical law (gravity, hookes law, w/e) and numerically integrate.

Pushing around pixels in practice however is hard with a capital H and this is just a simulation of frictionless colliding rigid bodies (no rotation, multiple contact point collisions, or constrained simulation)

As usual, the underpinning rendering and programming routines were all implemented from scratch (webgl, seperating axis theorem, impulse collision response, euler integration etc)

In the future, time/ interest willing, I hope to improve upon this first stab and dig deeper into the subject.

Rendering Side of Things:
---------------------------------------------------
Vanilla WebGL with some boilerplate code and glmatrix as my vector and matrix library.

* Wireframe shader via barycentric coordinates from vertices.

If I were to do this as a fuller project I'd like to add instancing/ batch rendering to really stress test things.

Programming Side of Things:
---------------------------------------------------

Visualization tests or articles for each main component:

* [Euler Method](../math/eulerMethod.md.html)  for numerical integration to propagate motion
* [Seperating Axis Theorem](../../projects/2Dphysics/SATVisualization/index.html) for narrow phase collision detection and contact normal
* [Impulse Based Collision Response](../physics/impulseBasedCollisionResolution.md.html)
* [Quadtree](../../projects/2Dphysics/quadTreeVisualization/index.html) for broadphase collision detection
