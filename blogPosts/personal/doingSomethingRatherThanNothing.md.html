The physical world forces one to be honest. 
This fact is an an obvious and necessary constraint to gaining real knowledge.

and as an unfortunate
 human flavored corrollary often apprehensive in the interest of not looking foolish.

 about the real world, but
the human implications also need to considered.

How much more prolific would Dirac have been had he been less worried about being wrong; had he adopted a more playful spirit a'la Feynman.
Who knows, maybe the fear of being wrong was the dominant motivation for studying physics 
in the first place and was a prime mover in creating his scientific oeuvre.

Reading Randy's article was very clear reminder to not worry about any of that.

This seems like a pretty popular article. It definitely has a wider reach than any of the stuff I've ever written up.
As an example for that, check out a much funnier (Randy)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGnMNor_r-Y&t=596s]
 reference this same series of articles. (check out his videos for some funny, cathartic game dev vlogs)

The article itself is rather poorly done. I think the author even recognizes this because he compleetly redid them, 
probably due to the convergence of their populariy and the same human impulses already described.
They're basically a reiteration of textbook derivations (See Ian Millington - Game Physics Engine Development), but way less
clear and lacking some precision in mathematical formalism. (also superficially, the Latex is broken and makes reading a pain)

All that said, it was still pretty helpful. It was helpful in consolidating other sources and forcing me to dig deeper to understand while giving me a decent high level overview.
I'm glad that guy wrote that article as a digipen student and felt self concious or otherwise motivated enough to extend and "correct" his original article.
The reproducibility of what is trying to be accomplished and the math/ physics it's dependent on shows me there
are definitely gaps in the author's understanding at the time, but none of that matters to me and by analogy when I do the same
and someone else can see my own knowledge or understanding gaps, it shouldn't matter to them either.

Lend their mutual strengths to one another. Be utterly honest but not physocologically invest in the results.

Accept where you are and recognize where you want to go

"A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new." - Albert Einstein

It's such a simple and stale sentiment, but nonetheless is worth repeating in myriad forms.

Act as a man in the arena, not as one of your imagined critics.
