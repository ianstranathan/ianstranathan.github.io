Overview
=======================================================================================

Snell's law is a long known empircal fact (wikipedia's [historical summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law#History) )
It can be recovered a priori by a variety of paths (no pun intended)

* Ray model & Fermat's principle with calculus
* Ray model & Fermat's principle with variational arguments
* Wavefront model & Huygen's princple with geometry

All approaches ultimately converge to the same result which of course they must but is satisfying and
educational to see

Ray model & Fermat's principle with calculus
=======================================================================================

**Fermat's principle:**<br>
The path taken by a ray between two given points is the path that can be traversed in the least amount of time
This is something that is taken for granted through early expsoure education, but the idea to ascribe behavior to nature was controversial in its time.
<!-- integral of speed with respect to distance was a minimum -->

Ray model & Fermat's principle with variational arguments
=======================================================================================

Wavefront model & Huygen's princple with geometry
=======================================================================================

It feels slightly out of place to bring in Huygen's principle as it occupies some middle 
ground between ray and wave representations of light, but it's strengthening to see a relationship derived
in many disparate ways. 
It's also very elegant in that Snell's law pops out as a purely geometrical argument.

**Huygen's principle:**<br>
Every point on a wavefront is itself the source of spherical wavelets, and 
the secondary wavelets emanating from different points mutually interfere.
The sum of these spherical wavelets forms the wavefront. 

Here is a picture of a wavefront as originally conceived by Huygen from Wikipedia

I don't want to repeat work and only derive something for myself if I don't understand it due to something having been handwaved or
not explained sufficiently clearly. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GcW9jWj4FM" >derivation</a> is well explained and animated,
so check it out.
