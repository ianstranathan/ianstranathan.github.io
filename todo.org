* Philosophy
1. Simplicity
2. Control
3. Lindy
4. YAGNI

** Simplicity:
Write the entire thing in org mode

** Lindy
Lindy system (not dependent on SSG flavor of the month)
- emacs, common lisp and org mode aren't going anywhere anytime soon

Emphasis on "Bottom Up" writing. (I should be able to write whenever I like, wherever I am)
I'm a perfectionist, just stick whatever isn't up to a standard in some-folder/Drafts and don't worry about it

** YAGNI:
- portability
  it's ok to be locked into my machine, dependencies are:
  emacs init file that has:
  1) SBCL + SLIME, Htmlize, org mode, UTF-8 formatting
  
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Design
** Styling
Whatever minimal css framework I don't have to care about/ can easily extend or override, e.g.:
https://simplecss.org/


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Technical Notes
- UTF-8 to keep non-english symbols
  (I fixed this by making it less general, uses my .init file
   My reasoning, I live in emacs, why use an additional shell script when I can just do it from emacs)
  
- math latex:
  + katex is faster than mathjax
  + https://amitp.blogspot.com/2019/02/emacs-org-mode-and-katex.html

- syntax highlighting:
  + org mode html export depends on htmlize (check to make sure it's installed)
    htmlize.el is available via MELPA
    (already available for modern emacs)

**  HOSTING
Domain name managed by iwantaname, github pages pointing to ianstranathan.com

** ORG NOTES

* Technical TODO
- [X] Exclude drafts from export
https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/32758/is-it-possible-for-org-publish-to-ignore-certain-sub-directories

- [X] Write CL script to inject some html for every page
  sbcl --load file.lisp
  (finish-website)
