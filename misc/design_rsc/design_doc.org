* Why?
  + I prefer Org-mode over the fragmented Markdown syntax for writing plaintext documents
  + I'm fine with hacking together my own CSS
  + The native LaTex features are nice
    
* What do I need?
  + small org-to-HTML converter
  + 

* What do I want
  + RSS Feed for a permanent anchor to my blog for someone else to potentially follow
    ( readers can be notified when new content is published )
  + An index of posts in reverse chronological order
    
* Brain-Dump
  + Use services like Disqus to manage comments

  + CSSTidy or something similar to compress css (minify / remove whitespace) to speed up loading times
