Confession time, I'm not a real programmer and am kind of bad at it. I spend a lot of time programming though
I'm reminded of the eloquent talks of Joe Armstrong.

I'm very shy because it's outside my historical wheelhouse

That said, I enjoy programming and see it as a unique tool to confirm more general or abstract things

I owe quite a bit of gratitude to my first (and best) physics teacher. It wasn't until I saw numerical methods
and visual representations of them that I knew I wanted to program.
