(This is from Casey Muratori:
 Shift the mindset from breaking up things into small pieces of data with associated members -> to -> small
 pieces of data with external functions that work across multiple pieces of data)

I don't think programming (after the initial hurdle of domain specific knowlegde) is any different from any other technical
area of human activity.

- be inquisitive
- be willing to get to the bottom of things (domain specific first principles)
- practice (program a lot)
- read programs as well as write them
