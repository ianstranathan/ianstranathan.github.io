Title: Non-arbitrary-platforming programming

Using software sucks most of the time (until you've beaten your neurons into submission from sheer use, then it's blood versus crips
partisianship -- emacs vs vim; blender vs. maya or whatever etc) because 
it's almost always arbitrary. Why press this key combination and not that, what nested setting must I toggle to do X, the list goes on and on.
This is the case because while making the software, the space of all choices was under constrained (this is why protocols exist and [funny 
cartoons too]()

I've noodled around with a game engine or two in my time and it's mostly caused me to try (unsuccessfully so far) my hand at making my own simple 
engines.
But sometimes that isn't always the appropriate response -- beyond the tenchical challeges of game developement, I think a huge hurdle is simply
being able to design interesting systems (finding the fun); rapidly iterating and allowing a system to take on its own expression is crucial to
making a fun game that is worth your precious, finite heart beats in developement time.

Ok, so we've accepted to tentatively use a game engine.
