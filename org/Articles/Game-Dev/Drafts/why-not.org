In essence, I feel the same about game development

I wish I could find the quote, but I'm reminded of Einstein asking a student, asking him if he finds what he's studying engaing enough
to occupy his curioity for the rest of his life.
Similarly, more poetically/ dramatically, I'm also reminded of a (I'm sure misremembered) injuction of Rumi (Mevlana) to love only the eternal.

Games are important in one sense from another illustrative Einsteinian sentiment: Knowledge is limited, imagination becomes the world.
All intelligent creatures like to play. To be fluid and improvisational, to enter a flow state is a highly pleasurable and commendable thing.
But that dampening of rigidity to allow dancing in possibility space should be projected onto the substratum of the "eternal".

By eternal, I mean non-arbitrary systems more or less.

Analogous to exotic algebras in mathematics (minus the assumed platonic existence most working mathematicians and physicists assume) games (coded,
looping systems) don't need to have a basis in reality.
An element in the set of all games is just as good as any other.
This leads to infinite regress (moral relativism)
