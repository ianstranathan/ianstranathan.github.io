This was my first serious project (first game-dev project that went beyond a game-jam scope / was able to maintain development discipline)

A name was never decided.
- Clicky
- Petri Pals
- RTSS

Lessons Learned:

Don't spend too much time with juice / polish / assets/ features
(Most of them will never see the light of day)
BUT
Spend enough time with juice / polish / assets/ features
(This is what a game is at its core and you can't say what's fun before building it)

It's a shitty balance to strike... there is where experience pays dividends
