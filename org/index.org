#+TITLE: Was weiss ich?
#+OPTIONS: title:nil

Greetings, I'm Ian and this a small archive for things I become interested in.

I studied Physics (B.S.), Math (B.S) and Mechanical Engineering (almost B.S) and I'm a hobbyist graphics programmer & game developer.

I'm motivated by understanding how things work and communicating ideas.

Writing doesn't just communicate ideas; it generates them.

There is a deep difference between [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NM-zWTU7X-k][knowing something and understanding it]]; writing can be useful scaffolding when trying to understand.
Sometimes that turns into a full post here.

Writing to help clarify my own thoughts necessarily distills the ideas through an imperfect filter. Hopefully there aren't too many mistakes.
Feel free to contact me for corrections or otherwise.

Cheers.
