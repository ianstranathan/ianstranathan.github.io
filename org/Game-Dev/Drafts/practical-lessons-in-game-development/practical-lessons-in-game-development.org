There are many ways to define games, but they're all various forms of feedback loops

Game design is a kind of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5K0uqhxgsE][optimization problem / search algorithm]] ; you're trying to make the best game you possibly can
(minimize risk, maximize resources; try out different ideas and gain feedback on what's fun -> constrain the system down from infinity
(the space of all possible games) in an optimal way (chosen path diverges from a desirable one))

This requires "bottom up development" (to borrow the phrase from Paul Graham); an experimental, undogmatic attitude that allows for rapid
playtesting. There is no ivory tower idea or platonic shadow for what's fun.

* Feedback loops or the importance of polish

These are the bulleted items from Steve Swink's "Game Feel - A Game Designers Guide to virtual sensation"

- Predictable results
  + When players take action, they get the response they expect. 
- Instantaneous response
  + The player feels the response to their input is immediate. 
- Easy but deep
  + The game takes minutes to learn but a lifetime to master. 
- Novelty
  + Though the result of an input is predictable, there is enough subtlety and expressiveness to keep the
    controls feeling fresh and interesting through hours and hours of play. 
- Appealing response
  + The sensation of control is aesthetically appealing and compelling, separate from context. 
- Organic motion
  + Controlling the avatar creates appealing arcs of motion. 
- Harmony
  + Each element of a gameâ€™s feel supports a single, cohesive perception of a unique physical reality for the player. 

All these points, except for maybe "Easy but deep", require well made feedback loops (visual, aural etc)
This requires "Polish".
"Polish" is an infinite yak waiting to be shaven.
It's 100% necessary, there is no game without polish, but care must be taken not to invest too much time in any single component
Ars longa, vita brevis...
