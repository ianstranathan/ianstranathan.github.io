Most great franchises were born from small games and incremental investment over decades.
This is no longer possible due to the maturity of the games industry
Game development is a very high risk (resources required to make a game) and

or worse

I did most of my formative gaming in a transition phase of the games industry. It was right after the paradigm shift between 2D & 3D
and development was increasing in complexity (stupid to say as this has always been the case)

 Trying to be the best built man in the world demands total seriousness,
 but in essence the seriousness and the ambition involved is a little silly." -Mike Mentzer

# A basic question one shoulder answer early on: Do I want to be involved in engineering games or do I want to make games./


In essence, I feel the same about game development

I wish I could find the quote, but I'm reminded of Einstein asking a student, asking him if he finds what he's studying engaing enough
to occupy his curioity for the rest of his life.
Similarly, more poetically/ dramatically, I'm also reminded of a (I'm sure misremembered) injuction of Rumi (Mevlana) to love only the eternal.

Games are important in one sense from another illustrative Einsteinian sentiment: Knowledge is limited, imagination becomes the world.
All intelligent creatures like to play. To be fluid and improvisational, to enter a flow state is a highly pleasurable and commendable thing.
But that dampening of rigidity to allow dancing in possibility space should be projected onto the substratum of the "eternal".

By eternal, I mean non-arbitrary systems more or less.

Analogous to exotic algebras in mathematics (minus the assumed platonic existence most working mathematicians and physicists assume) games (coded,
looping systems) don't need to have a basis in reality.
An element in the set of all games is just as good as any other.
This leads to infinite regress (moral relativism)
