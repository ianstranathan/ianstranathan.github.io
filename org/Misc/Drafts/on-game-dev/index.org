Tl, dr:
Games are incredibly hard to make. ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE1Rm7F7f20][Don't just take my word for it]]).
There is a fundamental sillyness involved in the effort.

* Fitness as an analogy

Fitness is one of my main hobbies.
I've been doing calisthenics and bodybuilding for about 10 years.

I remember at the beginning I was humbled when I first read about protein synthesis rates.
(It takes a long time).

This lead me to research what I could about upper limits / genetic potential parameters
(All beginners do this. It's natural to try and project for something that's going to take a long time.)

A more experienced lifter told me not to worry about such things -- that it's overwhelmnigly more
likely that one reaches their lifestyle potential rather than their genetic potential.
(Is fitness a thing that you do or /THE/ thing that you do.)

The logical conclusion of this is best said by the legendary Mike Mentzer:

"Trying to be the best built man in the world demands total seriousness,
but in essence the seriousness and the ambition involved is a little silly.” -- [[https://www.musculardevelopment.com/news/the-mcgough-report/13217-mike-mentzer-the-untold-story-muscular-development.html][Mike Mentzer]]

There is only so much time and effort you realistically want to dedicate to this.
(Law of diminishing returns I guess)

* Generalized Game development or /gaming/ as a way of life

The thought first occured to me while trying to play "The Witness" years ago.
There was a contrived series of puzzles in which its connecting principle arbitrarily changed midway through.
I think the meta-pattern was trying to teach gestalt like reasoning/ critical thinking. (Not a real term)
Observing and grokking in accordance with "reality".
This brought to mind something like:

"Why not, regardless of the complexity or detail of this virtual world, just go observe patterns in
the real world?"

Self aggrandizingly (I'm likely in crank territory now), I think this is a flavor of asking about the foundations of mathematics.

The physical substratum is mostly irrelevant. Games are Self-expression and improvisation

* On the importance of games
The emminent game developer Masahiro Sakurai explaining why he chose to dedicate time
to game design education rather than continued game development:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“The world is constantly seeing new game releases.
Lots of people are doing their best out there.
Rather than add one more title to that deluge,
I thought the channel might give all games a little quality boost and
I hope from the bottom of my heart that I’ve contributed at least a bit of
wind to the industry sails.”
#+END_QUOTE

* Outro
Developing a game is a search process to find the fun,
or rather, /designing/ a game is.

Making a game is a painful

To channel an Wattsian perspective, maybe this should be recast as a more terpsichorean act.
