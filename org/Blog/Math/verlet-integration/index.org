/Just here to prove it to myself while noodling around with some code./

*Recall* the definition of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series][taylor series expansion]] with the normal caveats of smoothness etc.
(Also, check out Madhava, Jason Gregory and Newton for historical development; it's also amusing to
think about the sheer volume of Stigler's law occurences throughout history; its also heady and humbling to
consider that this was initially used to calculate Halley's Comet trajectories and now it's a back of a napkin exercise )

# \frac{f^{n}(a)}{n!}
# \left( x - a \right)^n
# \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}

$$ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{n}(a)}{n!} \left( t - a \right)^n $$

Where $a$ is the point around which we're expanding and $t$ is the variable we're creating
the expansion for.

For a simulation, with a discrete time step associated with the physics tick/ cycle, $\Delta{t}$, 
we need to be careful about /what/ and /where/ we're expanding.

We want to know what happens at the next time step:  $x\left( t + \Delta{t} \right)$
(This means we're creating an expansion for a function that can talk about that point.)

We know what is happening at the current step, so our expansion is expanding around that point: $a = t$

Subsituting into the Taylor series formula:
(Note: \left( t - a \right) \rightarrow \left( t + \Delta{t} - t \right) = \left( \Delta{t} \right) )

$$ \implies
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{n}(t)}{n!} \left( \Delta{t} \right)^n $$

This is if it's a forward time step.
If it's a backward time step, all that would change is
that we'd be expanding for $x\left( t - \Delta{t} \right)$

$$ \implies
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{n}(t)}{n!} \left( -\Delta{t} \right)^n $$

The /trick/ or method is to sum (simple verlet) or take the difference (stoermer-verlet) of the two.

Summing allows the even powers in the expansion to cancel which gives the method
its stability ($E \propto O^4$, i.e. the threshold for ignored higher ordered terms).

Expanded, truncated and summed:
$$\implies
x\left( t + \Delta{t} \right) + x\left( t - \Delta{t} \right) =
2x\left( t \right) + a\left( t \right) {\left( \Delta{t} \right)}^2$$

$$\implies x\left( t + \Delta{t} \right) =
2 x\left(t \right)  - x\left( t - \Delta{t} \right) + a\left( t \right) {\left( \Delta{t} \right)}^2$$

We can talk about the position at the next time step if we know the current position, the last position and the
current acceleration resolution.
