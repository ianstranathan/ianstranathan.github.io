** To project onto 3D space, find where the 4D vector intersects subspace where w = 1
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The 3-dimensional representation of a homogeneous point is obtained by dividing by the w coordinate
This is the same as taking the intersection of the direction given by the homogenous point in 4-dimensions
with the plane or the subspace in 4-dimensions where w = 1

** Grade
The grade of an object is the number of vectors wedged to create it.
- scalars    : 0
- vectors    : 1
- bivectors  : 2
- trivectors : 3
  etc.

** 3D Multivector algebra
- 1 scalar element: $$ \alpha $$
- 3 vector elements: $$ x, y, z $$
- 3 bivector elements:
  * $$e_2 \wedge e_3$$
  * $$e_3 \wedge e_1$$
  * $$e_1 \wedge e_2$$
- 1 trivector element:
  * $$e_1 \wedge e_2 \wedge e_3$$

** Cross product deforms from a matrix, why?
You're supposed to use the inverse transpose

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When we're taking a cross product, we're not actually creating a vecotor like all the textbooks say.
We're creating a bivector.

Proof that the wedge product is distributive over addition of vectors (Alan Macdonald's text is too terse to include this diagram.)
