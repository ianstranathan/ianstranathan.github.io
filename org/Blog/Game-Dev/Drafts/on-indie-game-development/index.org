/As a caveat/ : I've only ever made games as a hobby, I'm sure these thoughts aren't applicable to games as an industry.

Many ideas seem fun on paper but don't pan out when you test them.

You can't be an expert in all fields.

This is true generally, but especially so in an interdiscplinary effort.

You can't be a great programmer and producer and artist and sound designer and composer...
