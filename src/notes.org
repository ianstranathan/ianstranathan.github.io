#+TODO: TODO DESIGN GOALS

* TODO
** LISP
- [-] Refactor
  - [X] -> get files -> concat matching higher dirs -> link versus p
  - [ ] if i'm so inclined, probably replace some lables functionality with maplist or something
  
** JS
- [ ] randomized quote at beginning of content?

** CSS
- [-] I'm id'ing the heirarchy of folders using the word div which is bad for obvious reasons -> folder
  - [X] change in .lisp
  - [ ] change in org-mode css

    
** HTML
- [X] All content on this site is Â© [Name], [Year]. Use of this content for training AI or machine learning models is expressly prohibited without prior written consent.

** MISC

* DESIGN
Just a block of articles that follow nested details/ summary structure

<details>
<summry>
</detals>

There can be a randomized quote (JS) on front page from quotes


* GOALS
- I should be able to start a document (alias the directory I'm working out of in rsc) and just write
- The lisp code should be as portable as possible
- No AI
