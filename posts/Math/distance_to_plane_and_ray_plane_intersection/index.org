* Motivation
------------------------------------------
/While watching [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq7dV4sR7lg][Casey Muratori write a raytracer]] recently, I noticed he characterized the equation of a plane equation in a weird way, so I decided to write out a quick derivation./

* Problem Set Up
------------------------------------------
What seemed weird to me was his expression for a plane:  $N^T \cdot P + d = 0$
Where $N^T$ is a normal to the plane, *P* is a point on the plane and *d* is the distance to the plane. The operator is the scalar product.

Non-standard notation aside, this just isn't an equation to generate a plane.

Let's make this explicit by showing the distance to a plane from any arbitrary point (not just the origin) using two different means

* Distance to a plane
------------------------------------------

** Via projection of point onto normal:
------------------------------------------

Repeating our drawing from above for an arbitrary point -- feel free to skip this one, just keeping things tidy.

The dot product of the relative position vector and the normal:

$\vec{QP} = \vec{Q} - \vec{P}$ 

By definition of the dot product
   
$$\vec{QP} \cdot \vec{n} = \lvert \lvert \vec{QP} \rvert \rvert \lvert \lvert \vec{n} \rvert \rvert \cos{\theta}$$


$$\implies \lvert \lvert \vec{QP} \rvert \rvert \cos{\theta} = \frac{\vec{QP} \cdot \vec{n}}{ \lvert \lvert \vec{n} \rvert \rvert}$$

In the case that the normal is unit length, this simplifies to our first result

** Via ray intersection
------------------------------------------

It's always encouraging to see the same result in multiple ways:

#+CAPTION: The same as above but from a different perspective
[[../../../img/Math/distance_to_plane_and_ray_plane_intersection/diagramTwoRay.png]]


The vector equation of a ray (really a line segment -- we just discard negative scaling values ℓ for the ray):
$\vec{ray} = \vec{r_0} + ℓ \vec{rd}$

Where $\vec{rd}$ is a unit vector in the ray direction.

In the case of just looking for the distance to the plane, the ray direction is $\pm$ the unit vector of whatever the normal vector happens
to be depending on what side of the plane the ray origin is on; where the ray origin is our arbitrary point $Q$

$\vec{rd} = \frac{\vec{n}}{\lvert \lvert \vec{n} \rvert \rvert}$  ;  $\vec{r_0} = \vec{Q}$

Substituting this into the plane equation:

$\left( \vec{Q} - ℓ \frac{\vec{n}}{\lvert \lvert \vec{n} \rvert \rvert} - \vec{P} \right) \cdot \vec{n} = 0$

Solving for ℓ:
(Rearranging and using properties of the dot product (distributive & $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{a} = {\lvert \lvert \vec{a} \rvert \rvert}^2$))

$\left(\vec{Q} - \vec{P} \right) \cdot \vec{n} - ℓ \frac{\vec{n}}{\lvert \lvert \vec{n} \rvert \rvert} \cdot \vec{n} = 0$

$\left(\vec{Q} - \vec{P} \right) \cdot \vec{n} - ℓ \frac{{\lvert \lvert \vec{n} \rvert \rvert}^2}{\lvert \lvert \vec{n} \rvert \rvert} = 0$

$\vec{QP} \cdot \vec{n} - ℓ \lvert \lvert \vec{n} \rvert \rvert = 0$

$ℓ = \frac{\vec{QP} \cdot \vec{n}}{\lvert \lvert \vec{n} \rvert \rvert}$

And again, in the case that the normal is unit length, this simplifies to our first result.

* Equation of a plane
------------------------------
Now that we've gorily (most might say unnecessarily) shown that the first expression $\hat{n} \cdot \vec{P} + d = 0$ is indeed the distance from the origin to the plane, we can now show that the second expression is an accidental sleight of hand by deriving the equation of a plane.

From [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)][*wikipedia]]*
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In a manner analogous to the way lines in a two-dimensional space are described using a point-slope form for their equations,
planes in a three dimensional space have a natural description using a point in the plane and a vector orthogonal to it (the normal vector) to indicate its "inclination".
#+END_QUOTE

*Some visual intuition*:
  
#+CAPTION: The dot product of a relative position vector and a normal must be zero to be on a plane
[[../../../img/Math/distance_to_plane_and_ray_plane_intersection/equationIntuition.png]]

A plane is defined for all $\vec{P^{\prime}}$ if $\left( \vec{P^{\prime}} - \vec{P} \right) \cdot \vec{n} = 0$, i.e. their dot product is zero (they're orthogonal to each other)

We can easily recover the more familiar implicit form ($Ax + By + Cz = d$) if we write out the expression in scalar form:

Some chosen inclination (a normal to the plane)
  
$\vec{n} = \left( A, B, C \right)$
And some chosen point on the plane
  
$\vec{P} = \left( a, b, c \right)$
And a variable point $\vec{P^{\prime}}$
  
$\vec{P^{\prime}} = \left( x, y, z \right)$

$\implies \vec{P^{\prime}} - \vec{P} = \left(x - a, y - b, z - c \right)$

And our plane is then: $\left( \vec{P^{\prime}} - \vec{P} \right) \cdot \vec{n} = 0 = \left(x - a, y - b, z - c \right) \cdot \left( A, B, C \right)$

Expanding the dot product:
$\left(x - a, y - b, z - c \right) \cdot \left( A, B, C \right) = A\left(x - a \right) + B\left(y - b \right) +  C\left(z - b \right)$

Distributing and collecting constants:
$A\left(x - a \right) + B\left(y - b \right) +  C\left(z - b \right) = Ax + By + Cz - \left(Aa + Bb + Cc \right) = 0$

Rewriting the constant values as a new constant $d$: let $d = Aa + Bb + Cc$$
$\implies Ax + By + Cz = d$

It's probably overkill at this point, but if you're still not convinced this is a plane, think about the [[https://www.desmos.com/calculator/znsfjtqcds][reduced version in 2D]], $By+Cx = \tilde{d}$.
This is just a line - for some $x$, there's some $y$, extending into 3D is no different.
  
* Ray Plane Intersection
---------------------------------
Finding the necessary distance a given ray (that is to say a given direction $\vec{rd}$) should travel to intersect with a plane is pretty straight forward.
If you're interested in this kind of stuff and unitiated, see this [[../../Graphics/ray_sphere_intersection/index.html][introduction I wrote]].

*Ray:* $\vec{ro} + t\vec{rd}$

*Equation for Plane*  $\left( \vec{P^{\prime}} - \vec{P} \right) \cdot \vec{n} = 0$

Substituting the intersecting point on the plane $\vec{P^{\prime}}$ for the rays position vector:

$\left( \left( \vec{ro} + t\vec{rd} \right) - \vec{P} \right) \cdot \vec{n} = 0$

By properties of dot products: 
$$\implies \vec{ro} \cdot \vec{n} + t \vec{rd} \cdot \vec{n} - \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = 0$$

Remembering that $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is the distance from the origin to the plane:
$$\implies \vec{ro} \cdot \vec{n} + t \vec{rd} \cdot \vec{n} - d = 0$$
(Notice how similar this is to the original expression from the video, a small sleight of hand in my opinion)
$$\implies t = \frac{d - \vec{ro} \cdot \vec{n}}{\vec{rd} \cdot \vec{n}}$$

Rational functions are discontinuous with a zero denominator; $\vec{rd} \cdot \vec{n} = 0$

Again by dot product properties, this implies that $\vec{n}$ and $\vec{rd}$ are orthogonal to each other, or the ray direction is parallel to the plane
So the equation seems to make physical sense.

* Wrapping Up
---------------------------------

This was kind of a dumb derivation. I started writing it because it was wrong to say that the first expression
$\hat{n} \cdot \vec{P} + d = 0$ is the equation of a plane.
It's really a kind of sleight of hand/ accident (sign error?) that the video gets
the *t* ray-intersection scalar out of their equation.
Planes and Ray-Plane intersections are basic concepts, but it's (always?) good to refresh fundamentals.
If nothing else, it hopefully fits the handmade ethos.

I wish programming culture used more standard math notation & was more explicit in derivations / language, but I'm sure programmers
are even more annoyed whenever they're forced to see scientists' unfortunate Matlab/ Python / Julia / R code.
